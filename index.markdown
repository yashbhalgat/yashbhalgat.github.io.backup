# Hi!


I am a final year student at the [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), India. I am pursuing a major (with honors) in [EE](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in) and a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in).

I have a GPA of 9.44 and I belong to the top 10 of my department. You can find my CV [here](https://yashbhalgat.github.io/CV_YashBhalgat.pdf).

I am very enthusiastic about solving problems on a combination of Computer Vision/Robot Vision, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition. I am also interested in Biometrics, Parallel Computing and Astronomy.

Currently, I am pursuing my Undergraduate Thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Vikram Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre) titled "**Orientation field Estimation in Latent fingerprints using Scattering Convolution Networks**".
