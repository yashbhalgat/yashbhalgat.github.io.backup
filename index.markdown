# Hi!


I am a Senior year undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai, India. I am pursuing a major (with honors) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in) and a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in).

I am very enthusiastic about solving problems on a combination of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition. I am also interested in Parallel Computing, Astronomy and Biometrics.

Currently, I am pursuing my Undergraduate Thesis under the guidance of [Prof. Vikram Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre) titled "**Orientation field Estimation in Latent fingerprints using Scattering Convolution Networks**".
