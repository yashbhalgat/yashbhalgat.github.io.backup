I am a Senior year undergraduate at [Indian Institute of Technology - Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in), Mumbai, India. I am pursuing a major (with honors) in [Electrical Engineering](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in) and a minor in [Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in).

I have a GPA of 9.44 and I belong to the top 10 of my department. You can find the details of my projects and research internships in my CV [here](https://yashbhalgat.github.io/CV_YashBhalgat.pdf).

I am very enthusiastic about solving problems on a combination of Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Pattern Recognition. I am also interested in Parallel Computing, Astronomy and Biometrics.
