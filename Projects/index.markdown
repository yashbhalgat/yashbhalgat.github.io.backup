## Under Construction

<!-- **_Modeling Gene Conversion_** project, NC State University, 2014

Advisor: Dr. Jeff Thorne, Bioinformatics Research Center, NC State University

This is my main project. We are trying to develop phylogenetic model counting amount of inter-locus gene conversion (IGC) in the evolution of multi-gene families. Our current program works for smallest multi-gene family (only 2 members). Our [paper](http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/06/11/molbev.msw114.short?rss=1) is published in MBE (Molecular Biology and Evolution). 

Here is the [github repository](https://github.com/xji3/JGT_MBE_2016).


**_Solvent Accessibility_** project, NC State University, 2013

Advisor: Dr. Jeff Thorne, Bioinformatics Research Center, NC State University

This was a 'left-over' project that I helped finished. I extracted solvent accessibility information from protein coding genes in several species (human, mouse and Ecoli). Another senior PhD student built probabilistic model based on these data. Details of this project can be found in this [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/master/Publication/Roles%20of%20Solvent%20Accessibility%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20in%20Modeling%20Protein%20Sequence%20Evolution.pdf) which I co-authored.

## Master Thesis


**_Laser Interference Lithography_** project, NC State University, 2012

Advisor: Dr. John Muth, EE Department, NC State University

The goal was to develop a fabrication process using the mask-free laser interference lithography to easily introduce periodic pattern onto devices. We wanted to use it for gas sensor fabrication to increase the surface to volumn ratio which primarily determines gas-sensor's sensitivity. Details can be found in my [ugly-written thesis](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27914ae129b83c237d03d68fec002646d1163f69/Publication/Laser%20Interference%20Lithography%20for%20Fabrication%20of%20Gas%20Sensors.pdf).

Here are some pictures for a taste of what I did.

## Undergraduate Research

**_SPP source_** project, Peking University, 2011

Advisor: Dr. Zhiping Zhou, EECS Department, Peking University

I did my undergraduate thesis in this lab. Part of the work I did was to find a good doping location for SPP source design. The idea was to imbed light source inside a plasmon waveguide. You could find details in this published [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27914ae129b83c237d03d68fec002646d1163f69/Publication/Effect%20of%20dipole%20location%20on%20profile%20properties%20of%20symmetric%20surface%20plasmon%20polariton%20mode%20in%20Au-Al2O3-Au%20waveguide.pdf) which I co-authored.

**_Plasmonic Lens_** project, Peking University, 2010

Advisor: [Dr. Jiasen Zhang](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~zhangjs/index.html), Physics Department, Peking University

The Goal was to design, fabricate and test rectangular shape plasmonic lense composit of nano-scaled slots on a 200nm thin gold film on glass substrate being able to generate sharper focus. This work stays unpublished. 

Due to detection limit, we could not provide direct proof that our device worked by the fact that our image detection system was only sensitive to XY plane (parallel to the device) of the optical field whereas the focus intensity mainly lied in Z direction. If possible, a near field optic probe may detect the focus point and give a direct proof. I show my simulated light intensity distribution at XY plane of the focus point together with experimental result below to give you an idea.

We did have direct proof if we modified the design to have the light field mainly in XY plane, but this one didn't have the property to generate a sharper focus. (Small Numerical Aperture)
