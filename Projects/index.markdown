# **Undergraduate Thesis**
## Latent Fingerprint Enhancement via Scattering Wavelet Networks

Advisor: [Prof. Vikram Gadre](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/vmgadre), Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay

Initially targeted for the FVC-ongoing competition, I am pursuing this as my undergraduate thesis with Prof. Vikram Gadre. Estimating orientation fields is very challenging in latent fingerprints. I proposed employing Mallatâ€™s group invariant scattering approach to tackle this problem. We are combining several ideas such as iterative scaling-based sparse dictionary representation and are viewing the fingerprint enhancement as a texture disambiguation problem.

_Updates_: In the stage II of this project, we have achieved an accuracy of 92.57% on the five-class fingerprint classification problem (and 96% on four-class) and a manuscript is in writing for the Pattern Recognition Letters Journal.

## Joint multi-modal representations for e-commerce catalog search by visual attributes,

Guide: Dr. Vikas Raykar and Amrita Saha

Used [CorrNets](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/NECO_a_00801), an autoencoder based architecture, to learn the joint representation for both the image and caption such that the two reps are embedded in the same space maximizing their correlation. Showed that these joint multi-modal representations are a viable alternative for searching large fashion catalogues without manual tagging. Presented as a poster in the seminar at IBM Research, Bangalore, India.

With specific recognition to stamp detection - segmentation, proposed a shape-based approach and a ranking algorithm for learning the 1st layer filters of our architecture. We also proposed a scheme to rank and choose the subset. The approach performs better than many competing approaches: K-SVD, Gabor filters and other deep learning techniques. Stamp detection accuracy of 94% and segmentation IoU (Intersection over Union) of 74.81%. [ [arXiv] ](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05001)

## Undergraduate Research

**_SPP source_** project, Peking University, 2011

Advisor: Dr. Zhiping Zhou, EECS Department, Peking University

I did my undergraduate thesis in this lab. Part of the work I did was to find a good doping location for SPP source design. The idea was to imbed light source inside a plasmon waveguide. You could find details in this published [paper](https://github.com/xiang-ji-ncsu/xiang-ji-ncsu.github.io/raw/27914ae129b83c237d03d68fec002646d1163f69/Publication/Effect%20of%20dipole%20location%20on%20profile%20properties%20of%20symmetric%20surface%20plasmon%20polariton%20mode%20in%20Au-Al2O3-Au%20waveguide.pdf) which I co-authored.

**_Plasmonic Lens_** project, Peking University, 2010

Advisor: [Dr. Jiasen Zhang](http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/~zhangjs/index.html), Physics Department, Peking University

The Goal was to design, fabricate and test rectangular shape plasmonic lense composit of nano-scaled slots on a 200nm thin gold film on glass substrate being able to generate sharper focus. This work stays unpublished. 

Due to detection limit, we could not provide direct proof that our device worked by the fact that our image detection system was only sensitive to XY plane (parallel to the device) of the optical field whereas the focus intensity mainly lied in Z direction. If possible, a near field optic probe may detect the focus point and give a direct proof. I show my simulated light intensity distribution at XY plane of the focus point together with experimental result below to give you an idea.

We did have direct proof if we modified the design to have the light field mainly in XY plane, but this one didn't have the property to generate a sharper focus. (Small Numerical Aperture)
